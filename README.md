# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This prework study guide contains various notes on HTML, CSS, Git, and Javascript to help prepare students who are enrolled in bootcamp prework. The guide will cover fundamental points within each topic to give students a good starting point when learning these subjects and prepare them for their upcoming bootcamp. In preparing this guide, I learned how to use Git and the Gitflow for version control of this project and how to push and merge changes into my GitHub repository. I also learned the basics of HTML script, CSS, JavaScript variables, methods, and fuctions, and how to merge all of these together into a cohesive webpage.
